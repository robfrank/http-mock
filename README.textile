*HTTP mock*

http-mock is a programmable http server written in Java. It uses the Jetty servlet container. 
Scope of this tool is to help in writing tests against third-party REST api allowing easy mocking.

Code speaks better:

<pre>
		// file to be serverd
		File html = new File("./src/test/resources/ProgrammableHandlerTest.html");
		ProgrammableHandler handler = new ProgrammableHandler()
				.handle("/index.html", html)
				.handle("/index.php", HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND);

		// start the server
		Server httpServer = new Server(8888);
		httpServer.setHandler(handler);
		httpServer.start();

</pre>
 
So the server will return the content of file when called on localhost:8888/index.html.
Calling it on localhost:8888/index.php will return a 404 error code. 
Not found (404) error code is the default response code for non-mapped urls.
